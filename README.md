I've improved MySQL Workbench skills, gained a deeper understanding of leveraging SQL data analysis to help shape the performance and direction of business, and solidified digital marketing domain knowledge, particularly Web Analytics, by exploring the database and writing multi-step SQL queries to work on real-world eCommerce use cases.

- Working as an eCommerce Database Analyst for a start-up online retailer.
- Exploring the database with multiple tables containing data about website activity, orders and products.
- Tackling the assignments and projects structured in way that follow the life of the company in chronological order.

  2. Website Measurement and Testing
